Day 1
#1Get the structure of the flights data set using the str() command.


Use the pull() function instead of the $ notation to achieve the same result as above. Save this as pulledCarrier
```{r}
flights %>% 
  pulledCarrier <- pull(carrier)
```


Use this function identical() to establish that the pulledCarrier and flightCarrier are the same.


Now try the same step as 8 with select() instead of pull. Save this as selectedCarrier


Use the identical() function to establish that selectedCarrier and flightCarrier are not the same.


Why arenâ€™t selectedCarrier and flightCarrier identical? Think about the data structure that select() returns compared to that for pull()/$
